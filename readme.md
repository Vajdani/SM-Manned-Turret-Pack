# Introducing... the Manned Turrets!
These player controlled turrets are capable of many things:
- Taking down bots with potatoes/AA rounds/Ratshot
- Watering soil plots
- Lighting up an area
- Rapidly disassembling anything with Explosive Rounds/Guided Missiles/Air Strikes
- Rapidly relocating yourself
- Bringing along the nuclear winter with mounted nukes

Be careful though, they're not invincible!

# All of this is available in survival, thanks to [Questionable Mark's Modded Craftbot Recipes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2816900681)!
